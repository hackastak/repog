## What is RepoG?

RepoG is a CLI tool that syncs your GitHub repositories to a local knowledge base, generates vector embeddings, and enables semantic search, Q&A, and AI-powered recommendations across your entire codebase.

**Key Features:**
- Sync owned and starred repositories to a local SQLite database
- Generate vector embeddings with multiple providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Voyage AI, Ollama)
- Semantic search across all your code using natural language
- Ask questions and get AI-synthesized answers (RAG) with multiple LLM providers
- Get repository recommendations for specific tasks
- Summarize repositories with AI

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install hackastak/tap/repog
```

### Download Binary

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/hackastak/repog/releases). See the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for version history.

### From Source

Requires Go 1.22+ and a C compiler (GCC or Clang) for CGO.

```bash
go install github.com/hackastak/repog/cmd/repog@latest
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your API Keys

You'll need a GitHub token and an API key for your chosen AI provider:

**GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**
1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Fine-grained tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta)
2. Create a new token with:
   - **Repository access**: All repositories (or select specific ones)
   - **Permissions**: `Contents: Read-only`, `Metadata: Read-only`

**AI Provider API Key** (choose one or more)
- [Google Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) - Embeddings and LLM
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) - Embeddings and LLM
- [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com) - LLM only
- [Voyage AI](https://dash.voyageai.com) - Embeddings only
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) - Access to 100+ models
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) - Local models (no API key needed)

### 2. Initialize RepoG

```bash
repog init
```

This will prompt you for your API keys and store them securely in your system keychain.

### 3. Sync Your Repositories

```bash
repog sync
```

This syncs both your owned and starred repositories by default.

### 4. Generate Embeddings

```bash
repog embed
```

### 5. Start Searching

```bash
repog search "authentication middleware"
repog ask "Which repos use PostgreSQL?"
repog recommend "building a CLI tool"
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `repog init` | Configure API keys and initialize the database |
| `repog sync` | Sync repository metadata and content |
| `repog embed` | Generate vector embeddings for synced repos |
| `repog search <query>` | Semantic search across your codebase |
| `repog ask <question>` | Ask questions with AI-synthesized answers |
| `repog recommend <task>` | Get repository recommendations |
| `repog summarize <repo>` | AI summary of a specific repository |
| `repog reconfig` | Update API keys or switch providers |
| `repog status` | View knowledge base statistics |

### Sync Options

```bash
repog sync                   # Sync both owned and starred (default)
repog sync --owned           # Sync only your own repositories
repog sync --starred         # Sync only starred repositories
```

## Data & Privacy

- **Local First**: All data is stored locally in `~/.repog/repog.db`
- **Secure Credentials**: API keys are stored in your system keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or Linux Secret Service)
- **Privacy**: Code is only sent to:
  - **GitHub API**: To fetch repository metadata and content
  - **Google Gemini API**: To generate embeddings and AI responses

## GitHub API Rate Limits

RepoG respects GitHub's rate limit of 5,000 requests per hour for authenticated users. Use `repog status` to check your remaining quota.

## Roadmap

RepoG is under active development. Here's what's coming next:

- **Performance** - Incremental syncing and re-ranking
- **TUI** - Improve usability by building RepoG terminal user interface using Bubbletea
- **Export capabilities** - Generate documentation and knowledge graphs from your repos
- **Code analysis** - Dependency graphs, language statistics, and complexity metrics
- **Multi-platform Git support** - GitLab, Bitbucket, and self-hosted Git servers

See the [issues page](https://github.com/hackastak/repog/issues) for planned features and discussions.
