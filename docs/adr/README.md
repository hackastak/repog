# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the RepoG project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records document important architectural decisions made in this project. They capture:
- **Why** a decision was made (context and constraints)
- **What** alternatives were considered
- **How** the decision was evaluated
- **What** the implications are (both positive and negative)

ADRs are a gift to your future self and other developers. They prevent the "why does our code work this way?" questions and preserve institutional knowledge.

## When to Write an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions about:
- **Architecture patterns**: Microservices vs. monolith, event-driven vs. request/response
- **Technology choices**: Database selection, external service providers, frameworks
- **Testing strategies**: What to test, how to test it, coverage expectations
- **Quality attributes**: Performance trade-offs, security patterns, reliability approaches
- **Standards and conventions**: Code organization, error handling, API design

**Don't** write ADRs for:
- Routine implementation details
- Obvious choices with no meaningful alternatives
- Decisions that can be easily reversed without cost

## How to Write an ADR

1. Copy the template from `~/Developer/My_Notes/3. Resources/Software_Engineering/Systems_Architecture/ADR_Template.md`
2. Number sequentially: `ADR-XXX-descriptive-name.md`
3. Use the decision as the title, not the topic (e.g., "Use PostgreSQL for Media Service" not "Database Selection")
4. Fill in all sections:
   - **Status**: Draft → Decided → Superseded
   - **Context**: Why this decision matters
   - **Evaluation Criteria**: What you're optimizing for
   - **Options**: 2-3 options with trade-off analysis
   - **Decision**: The chosen option and why
   - **Implications**: Both positives AND negatives
   - **Consultation**: Who was involved
   - **References**: Links to related ADRs or docs

5. Reference the ADR in code where relevant: `// See ADR-XXX for why we...`

## ADR Status Lifecycle

- **Draft**: Under discussion, not yet finalized
- **Decided**: Approved and currently in effect
- **Superseded by ADR-XXX**: Replaced by a newer decision
